	abstract = {Spintronics, that is, the utilization of electron spin to enrich the functionality of microelectronics, has led to the inception of numerous novel devices, particularly magnetic random-access memory ({MRAM}). Over the last decade, signiﬁcant effort has been devoted to magnetization manipulation using spin-orbit torque ({SOT}), which shows great promise for ultrafast and energy-efﬁcient {MRAM}. In this Perspective, we summarize the latest progress in the study of {SOT} and highlight some of the technical challenges facing the development of practical {SOT} devices. After introducing the basic concepts of {SOT} and its relevance for magnetization switching, we will focus on several methods to realize deterministic {SOT} switching in the absence of an external ﬁeld, which is a requirement for practical {SOT} devices. Additionally, we summarize the materials used in {SOT} devices. The ﬁnal section is devoted to the most important recent advances in the application of {SOT} devices, including {SOT}-{MRAM}, spin logic, spin Hall nano-oscillators, and neuromorphic devices.},

	abstract = {Efﬁcient generation of spin–orbit torques is central for the exciting ﬁeld of spin-orbitronics. Platinum, the archetypal spin Hall material, has the potential to be an outstanding provider for spin–orbit torques due to its giant spin Hall conductivity, low resistivity, high stabilities, and the ability to be compatible with {CMOS} circuits. However, pure clean-limit Pt with low resistivity still provides a low damping-like spin–orbit torque efﬁciency, which limits its practical applications. The efﬁciency of spin–orbit torque in Pt-based magnetic heterostructures can be improved considerably by increasing the spin Hall ratio of Pt and the spin transmissivity of the interfaces. Here we review recent advances in understanding the physics of spin current generation, interfacial spin transport, and the metrology of spin–orbit torques and summarize progress toward the goal of Pt-based spin–orbit torque memories and logic that are fast, efﬁcient, reliable, scalable, and nonvolatile.},

              Spin-orbit torques ({SOTs}) have been widely understood as an
              interfacial
              transfer of spin that is independent of the bulk properties of the magnetic layer. Here, we report that {SOTs} acting on ferrimagnetic Fe

              layers decrease and vanish upon approaching the magnetic compensation point because the rate of spin transfer to the magnetization becomes much slower than the rate of spin relaxation into the crystal lattice due to spin-orbit scattering. These results indicate that the relative rates of competing spin relaxation processes within magnetic layers play a critical role in determining the strength of {SOTs}, which provides a unified understanding for the diverse and even seemingly puzzling {SOT} phenomena in ferromagnetic and compensated systems. Our work indicates that spin-orbit scattering within the magnet should be minimized for efficient {SOT} devices. We also find that the interfacial spin-mixing conductance of interfaces of ferrimagnetic alloys (such as Fe
